# HL_motion_generation
This package implements a simple example of a motion planning algorithm able to compute intrinsically Human-Like motion in the Cartesian domain. It is based on functional Principal Component Analysis, which permits the extraction of a reduced functional representation of the human hand motion in the Cartesian domain.

To test this example, you only have to run the script "main_planning.m", setting in the first part of the script the initial and the final desired position.
